Seriously, we only use this issue tracker for bugs in the library itself and feature requests for it.
We don't typically answer questions or help with support issues here.

If you have a question or need support on our library, please read our [Support Document](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js/blob/master/.github/SUPPORT.md)
